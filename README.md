## Python Project Ideas for Beginners 
***

> 
*Well, if you’ve just started out learning Python or are in a stage where you really want to get your hands dirty, then this article is for you. We have discussed a few Python projects here for you to delve deep and get expertise:*

* **Email Slicer**

Email Slicer is nothing but just a tool that will take an email id as an input and will perform slicing operations on it to return the username and the domain of the email id.

* **Number to Words**

This Python project can make you spell out the numbers as you may define. This Python code will help you support more than a million inputs along with the non-positive integers like zero, negative integers, or floating numbers. 

* **Google Image downloader**

Need a bunch of images for your new project? Then just run this program and download any number of images for a  topic. Only ensure that you do not violate copyright issues and give due credit to the owner if needed. 

* **Contact List**
As old school as it may sound, creating a contact list, adding contacts along with phone numbers or emails, and editing them, is still prevalent. To create one, you can use the SQLAlchemy library which uses SQLite to store contacts. 

* **Monty Hall Simulation Problem**

Monty hall problem comes from a famous movie where three doors are used to help you win a car. How? Each door hides something behind it–a car and two goats. Any door can have the car while the remaining two have goats. The probability to find a car is ⅓. Now, if you select Door 1 and the host opens Door 3 to find a goat, your chances just become ⅔. This program will help you solve this problem. 

* **Image to Sound**

You can create sound from image files now. Imagine displaying an image from the forest with the actual forest sound in the background–just adds to the drama. For this to run, have an image file and sound file (in .mp3 format) ready. 
* **Snake Game**

With older Nokia phones, we had an old-age addiction to the snake game. But of course, we don’t have it anymore. What if you could write one for yourself using Python?

* **GIF Creator**

As famous as the gif market has become over these years now, demand for quality gifs is going up. To expand your horizon, if you find a video that might make a good GIF, then just convert that video into a gif using this Python Project.

* **Website blocker**

Aren’t we all tired of random pop-ups during site surfing? So, we can create website blockers for restraining pushy ads by creating this Python project.
Remember, when you code this, you can add the sites you need to block by editing sites_to_block, changing the host, or editing the time when you need to block the sites.

* **Binary Search Algorithm**

As the binary term explains, the system will take any input starting from 0 to any range that you specify and display a range of numbers with a difference of two.

* **Mad Libs Generator**

The program design is such that it will ask users to enter a series of inputs that will be considered as a Mad Lib.

The input could be anything, an adjective, a noun, a pronoun, etc. Once all the inputs are entered, the application will take the data and arrange the inputs into a story template form. Sound fun, right?

* **Dice Rolling Simulator**

The number will then be displayed to the user. It will also ask users if they would like to roll the dice again. The program should also include a function that can randomly grab a number within 1 to 6 and print it. These beginner-level python projects will help build a strong foundation for fundamental programming concepts.

* **Hangman**

This is more of a “guess the word” game. The core concepts you have to use while developing this project are variables, random, integer, strings, char, input and output, and boolean. In the game, users have to enter letter guesses, and each user will have a limited number of guesses (a counter variable is needed for limiting the guesses). This is one of the interesting python projects, to begin with. 
You can create a pre-organized list of words that users can grab words from. Also, you must include specific functions to check whether or not a user has entered a single letter if the input letter is in the hidden word if the user has actually inputted a single letter, and to print the correct outcomes (letters).

* **Desktop Notifier App**

Have you ever wondered how notifications work? This small python project idea will throw some light on this. The desktop notifier apps run on your system and send you a piece of information after a fixed interval of time. We suggest you use libraries such as notify2, requests, etc. to build such a program.

* **Python Story Generator**

This is a fun but exciting python project which will work wonders with kids. In a nutshell, the program will ask users for inputs such as the name of a place, action, etc. and then build a story around the data. The story will be the same always but with little variation with the input.

* **YouTube video downloader**

One of the best ideas to start experimenting with your hands-on python projects for students is working on a YouTube video downloader. More than a billion people watch YouTube every month. Sometimes there are videos we like to download permanently. YouTube doesn’t give you that option, but you can create an app with a simple UI and the ability to download YouTube videos in different formats and video quality. This project looks tough, but it is straightforward when you start working on it.

* **Spin a Yarn**

Things get more interesting here since strings are infinitely more complex to play with at the beginning.

The program first prompts the user to enter a series of inputs. These can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc. Once all the inputs are in place, they are placed in a premade story template using concatenation. In the end, the full story is printed out to read some misintended madness!

* **What’s the word?**

This name focuses on the user having to guess the randomly generated word. You can create a list from which the word would have to be guessed and also set a cap on the number of guesses allowed.

After this, you can create the rules yourself! When the user inputs the word, you can indicate whether the alphabet written appears in this particular position or not. You will need a function to check if the user is inputting alphabets or numbers and to display error messages appropriately.

* **Rock, Paper, Scissors**

If you are tired of having no playmate, then a 5-minute stint of rock, paper, scissors with the computer and designed by you, yourself will improve your mood.

We again use the random function here. You make a move first and then the program makes one. To indicate the move, you can either use a single alphabet or input an entire string. A function will have to be set up to check the validity of the move.

* **Leap it!**

In this python project, you input a year and check whether it is a leap year or not. For this, you’ll have to create a function that recognizes the pattern of leap years and can try fitting the inputted year into the pattern. In the end, you can print the result using a boolean expression.

* **Find out, Fibonacci!**

You input a number and the function created checks whether the number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence or not. The underlying workings are similar to the above ‘Leap it!’ program.

One common theme in all the above projects is that they will help you to get your basics right. You will be the developer and the bug fixer. Not to mention, you’ll be closing working with creating and implementing a variety of functions along with working with variables, strings, integers, operators, etc. Just like 2 + 2 is the building block of your mathematics knowledge, so are these concepts, and learning about them in a fun way through building projects will help to understand and retain them more.

## Python Project Ideas for Intermediate
***

> 
*If you have a little expertise with Python projects, you can directly start building these projects. These projects are for intermediate users who have some knowledge and wish to create more.*

* **Image to Story**
Want to create amazing stories from images? This project will let you produce a sentence after capturing the image. For this to work, download some pre-trained models and style vectors.

* **Number Guessing**

It a fun project to guess the number after getting a few hints from the computer. So, the system will generate a number from 0 to 200 and ask the user to guess it after a clue. Every time a user gives a wrong answer, another hint pops up to make it easier for them.

* **Voice Assistant**

Looking at the market majorly, we realise voice assistants are all up to take over our tasks. Siri, Alexa, and OkGoogle are already leading the market. How about you have a personal assistant of your own> Create your own voice assistant using this Python program.

* **Password Generator**

The most difficult part of managing multiple accounts is generating a different strong password for each. A strong password is a mix of alphabets, numbers, and alphanumeric characters. Therefore, the best use of Python could be building a project where you could generate random passwords for any of your accounts.

* **Reddit Bot**

We all have used Reddit for one purpose or the other. The famous question-answer app can now also have a bot linked to it. The bot will automate comments on the posts based on specified criteria.

* **Black Jack**

Creating the most famous card game of the casinos in Python would be a wonderful project. This game is played with a deck of 52 cards where the strategies play at best. Shuffle the cards, announce the buy-in amount, and decide the ranking of the cards. For ex. If Ace is given number 1 or 11. The player who gets the value of cards to 21 wins the game.

* **Recursive Triangle**

This program creates a triangle using stars, recursively.

* **Queue**

Implements queue data structure. A queue is an entity that maintains the data in a linear format and processes it in FIFO order.

* **Calculator**

Although there isn’t much use of a calculator, however, building your graphical UI calculator will make you familiar with a library like Tkinter in which you can create buttons to perform different operations and display results on a screen.

* **Countdown Clock and Timer**

It is another utility app in which the user can set a timer, and the app notifies you when time is up.

* **Random Wikipedia Article**

This is a complicated yet straightforward program. The program searches Wikipedia and fetches a random article. Then it asks the user if he wants to read that article or not. If the answer is yes, the material is shown; otherwise, another random report is presented.
* **Python Command-Line Application**

Python is known for building outstanding command-line applications. You can create your program, which can help you send emails to other people. The program will ask your credentials and the content of the email, then send the data using your created command line.

* **Alarm Clock**

This is one of the interesting python project ideas. People all across the globe use alarm clock applications. It is quite a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) Python application for an intermediate-level developer. However, this project isn’t your run-of-the-mill alarm clock. In this application, you can input YouTube links in a text file and design the application to read the file. If you set a particular time in the alarm clock, it will pick a random YouTube link from the text file and play the YouTube video.

* **Tic-Tac-Toe**

We all have fond memories of playing Tic-Tac-Toe with our friends in school, don’t we? It is one of the most fun games you can play anywhere – all you need is a pen and paper! Usually, two players can play Tic-Tac-Toe at a time. The players create a 3×3 square grid. This is one of the coolest python project ideas. 

While the first player puts “X” in any one of the squares, and the second player will put an “O” in any square. This process will continue until all the squares are filled with each player putting X and O alternatively. The player who succeeds in creating a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal with three consecutive X or O on the grid wins.

You can use the Pygame library for building this project. Pygame is loaded with all the modules you need for computer graphics and sound.

* **Steganography**

Steganography is the art of hiding a secret message in another form of media, for example, hiding a coded message in an image or video. You can create a program that protects messages inside pictures for you.

* **Currency converter**

This is a simple GUI application that you can develop using Python. As you can guess by the name, you will build a currency converter that can convert currencies from one unit to another, for example, converting Indian rupee into pound or euro.

The design of this application will be straightforward – the main focus should be the primary function, that is, converting currency units from one to another. You can use Tkinter, the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped along with Python.


* ** Post-it Notes**

Post-it notes are an excellent way to note down trivial chores so that you don’t forget to do them. In this project, we’ll make a virtual version of the physical, adhesive post-it notes. The main goal of building this application is to allow users to carry their post-it notes wherever they go (since it is on a digital platform).

The application should have an option for account creation, different layouts for post-it notes, and a categorization feature to allow users to segment their notes. You can consider using Django for this project since it has an in-built user authentication feature.

* **Site Connectivity Checker**

The job of a site connectivity checker is to visit a URL and display the status of that URL, that is, whether or not it is a live URL. Usually, site connectivity checkers visit URLs at regular intervals and return the results each time. This project will work on the same lines – it will check the live status of URLs. Site connectivity checker is one of the interesting python projects for beginners.

You must design the code for this application from scratch. As for your connections, you can either opt for TCP or ICMP. You can use click, docopt, or argparse frameworks for adding commands that will enable users to add and delete URLs from the list of URLs they want to check. 

* **Directory Tree Generator**

A Directory Tree Generator lets you visualize the relationship between files and directories, thereby making it easier to understand the positioning of files and directories. For this project, you can use os library to list the files and directories within a specific directory. Again, docopt or argparse frameworks are excellent tools for the project. 

## Python Project Ideas for Advanced Users
***

*These Python projects are for all those developers who wish to explode the market with high-end applications for use*

* **Content Aggregator**

Surfing through various websites to collate the best material for content is a tedious task. With this Python Project, searching and collating all the resources and materials in one place, becomes a lot easier.

* **Face Mask Detection**

With the current pandemic times, a face mask is highly appreciated wherever we go. But it also becomes tiresome to manually detect people without a mask. This Python Project lets you detect a mask and prompt any error. This can be applied in malls or any public meeting place. 

* **Plagiarism Checker**

A nightmare for a writer is whether or not the written work falls into plagiarism barriers. Plagiarism tool scans through your work to find an overlap from an existing source posted online. 

To avoid any overlap for stealing someone’s work, we tend to put our work through plagiarism checkers. But the tools cost a fortune. So, with this Python project, you can create a plagiarism checker to scour through any writing work. This Python project uses a Natural Language Processing tool along with a search API to prepare a full-fledged usable Plagiarism checker. 

* **Music Player**

Almost everyone loves to listen to music. Imagine, creating a music player of your own that involves scanning through project files to find music files, browse through various tracks, add music from your favorite artists, or control the volume. 

With this Python project, you create a full-fledged music player with an interactive UI to play around with.

* **Bulk File Rename/ Image Resize Application**
This is an advanced project which needs you to be well-versed in Machine Learning. We will begin by teaching the program on how to pre-process data, then perform a few resize and rename images tasks. As the program starts learning, it can handle bulk functions at once.

* **Python File Explorer**

This is a significant project as it will test your knowledge on the various concepts of Python. You need to build an app that anyone uses to explore the files in their system. You can also add features like searching and copy-paste. Tkinter is a commendable choice for this project as it makes the development of GUI applications fast and easy.

* **Expense Tracker**

As you can guess by the name, an expense tracker is a software application that lets you keep track of your expenses, and even analyze the expenses. In this python project, you will build a simple expense tracker that can keep track of the user’s expenses.

Expense tracker is one of the trending python projects which should also be able to perform statistical analysis to give accurate insights to users on their expenses so that they can plan their expenses better. You can use PySimpleGUI to create the interface for this application, and even Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib can be handy tools for the project.

* **Instagram Photo Downloader**

This would be an app that automatically downloads all the Instagram images of your friends. As Instagram is growing everyday, this is one of the useful python projects and it is quite similar to the above command line app as this app will use your credentials to open your account and then look for your friend’s ID and download their photos. This app would be handy when people want to delete pages and save just the images.

* **Quiz Application**

This is one of the interesting python project ideas to create. This is a standard quiz application that presents a set of carefully curated questions to the users (a questionnaire), allows them to answer the same, and displays the correct answer if they are wrong. Each test will display the final score of the user. The application will have an account creation option, wherein some users can be appointed as Admins.

These Admins can create tests for other users. In this way, the tests and quizzes continue to be updated. This application requires a database to store all the questions, answers, and scores of the users. You can also include additional features like timers for tests.
